	<h1>Hi there, I'm Austin! &#128075</h1>
	<p>I’m a Master's Student @ UC Berkeley studying Data Science, where I also completed my undergrad in Computer Science and Data Science. I’m passionate about making technology more accessible, which is why I’ve devoted my efforts to building an online data science course, supporting early-stage startups, and working with non-profits to create applications with human-centered design. I'm also interested in exploring the intersection of data science and healthcare applications. There’s so much untapped potential that could transform lives all around the world!
