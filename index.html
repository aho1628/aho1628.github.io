	<h1>Hi there, I'm Austin &#128075!</h1>
	<p>I’m a senior @ UC Berkeley studying Computer Science + Data Science. I’m passionate about making technology more accessible, which is why I’ve devoted my efforts to building an online data science course, supporting early-stage startups, and working with non-profits to create applications with human-centered design. I'm also interested in exploring the intersection of data science and healthcare applications. There’s so much untapped potential that could transform lives all around the world!
